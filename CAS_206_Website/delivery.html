    <h2>Delivery History</h2>
    <p>Way back in 1891 The Nines Bakery began the first delivery option for fresh bakery. Back in those day we specialized in bread and flour, but our heritage in quality delivery hasn't changed. However, our mode of transportation has. </p>
    <p>The two horse you see are Nines and Bakery. Their bloodline still lives on to this day and can be seen at the <a href="http://beaverlakestables.com" target="_blank">Beaver Lake Stables</a> outside of Oregon City.  </p>

    <h2 class="padding">All Electric Fleet</h2>
    <p>We've upgrade our ponies from 2 horse to a fleet of all electric delivery vehicles. Our delivery cars are always on the go guaranteeing delivery to your door with the freshest muffins and doughnuts available in Oregon. </p>
    <p>In part of keeping our product fresh, we also work to keep our plant fresh. We deploy the only all electric delivery car system in the North West. Now not only when you purchase Nines Bakery's amazing muffins and doughnuts are you enjoying Oregon's best bakery, but you are also helping to keep Oregon green. Now thats fresh thinking.  </p>
